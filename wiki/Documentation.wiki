*Room Creator*<br>The top row in the grid is to specify the front of the class. The bottom row is to specify the back of the class. The left is for left and right is for right. This allows the teacher to specify seats to help with the seating. The seats can also be marked as left handed, nonseats, and not used. This also allows the seat to be vacant or allows the seating to try and place left handed people in the left handed seats. To mark seats accordingly, use either the select buttons to select rows or columns or individually select the seats to change. Then go to the right and use these options to actually change properties. Left handed seats will have red text, non seats will be dark grey, and not usable seats will be light grayed out. This also helps the seating to avoid the seats that arent used. Make Isles non-seats. After the room is to your liking, either exit out of the window or save the room for later use as a template. If you save it as a template, it will allow you to load this room in later projects. Loaded room templates can be changed for specific classes without modifying the template.<br>
